- dedicated methods instead of commented code 
- self explaining code, instead of commenting it 
- calculate total for line item should be computed by the lineItem object itself
- Duplicated code: calculating total for line item
- Feature envy: summing line items total should be computed by the lineItemList object itself 
- Duplicated code: summing order total
- private getter is useless
- Feature envy: instance method passing (another) instance, writeOrder should be either a class method or not require another instance as argument
- initialize variable on declaration, where possible
- declare Vector type and Iterator type
- Feature envy: lineItem should not reference to the containing lineItemsList
- lineitemlist class is redundant, remove it

- remove unnecessary indirections
- remove unused code ?
